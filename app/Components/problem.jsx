                If you're like many students and professionals, your Notion workspace is full of notes, but studying and retaining that information feels like a struggle. You've tried different methodsâ€”flashcard apps, separate tools, even traditional notecardsâ€”but nothing sticks. Constantly switching between tools adds frustration, making the process disjointed.
                </p>
                <p>
                Despite your detailed Notion notes, they feel static and unengaging, and traditional flashcard methods seem outdated. Study sessions turn into repetitive cycles of re-reading with no real retention. Manually creating flashcards or embedding other tools just adds complexity.
